#### areas I want to avoid:

- advertisement

#### business values:

- customer centric/satisfaction (the idea is that happy customers, give a lot of value over there lifetime, so instead of focusing on sales and have a bad retention, I'd rather have fewer but happier customers and those will refer the product to otheres, which in turn will lead to organic lasting growth, albeit way slower. examples are dota2 or any valve game really as they don't run adds, also not publicly traded)
  - customer happiness > â‚¬
  - no bullshit lock in, so the only reason the customers stays is, because it is to hard to switch
  - existing customers > new customers (no garbage banners on the website to get you to sign up only because you are not logged in, e.g. github, or annoying af grammerly shit, that spams you because you are not logged in)
- employees, interest and dedication > xp
- remote only
- documentation is extremely important, esp because of remote
- openness, open source, public issues where possible


#### business criteria

- SaaS
- B2B
- bootstraped
- has to contain atleast one of my interests

#### avoid in a business:

- B2C
- any hardware product
- publicly traded companies


#### companies I'd love to work at(except my own^^):

- GitLab
- Stripe
