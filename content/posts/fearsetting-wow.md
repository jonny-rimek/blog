### 1. What if I start wowmate.io?

define what could go wrong | prevent | repair
-|-|-
I could get sued for some law (GDPR, Unternehmensgr√ºndungs kram) and lose a lot of money | read guides, maybe reach out to other founders and ask for advice | hire a lawyer (with what money tho..)
I could fuck up the way I handle money and break some laws by accident | read guides, maybe reach out to other founders and ask for advice | hire a lawyer (with what money tho..)
I could fail and spiral into a depression | get a dog <3 | ask friends & psychiatrist for help 
I could get hacked | best practices, top security flaws, get an audit | be open about the problem, fix asap, mb get outside help, if I already have money
Working fully remote without anyone to answer to might be bad for my emotional health. no schedule, lonlyless| get a dog <3 | ask friends & psychiatrist for help

### 2. What might be the benefits of the attempt or partial success?

- I will learn a shit ton about:
  - aws/serverless
  - go
  - vuejs
  - how to found a business in germany
  - a ton of bureaucratic gargabe that I have to deal with
  - running a bootstrap company
  - how to get users
  - communication with your users
  - ..
- moneyzzz, possibly
- partial or fulltime home office
- might build something of a network that might be helpful for the future
- landing a great remote job at a company like stripe

### 3. The cost of inaction (emotionally, physically, financially)

- staying at a somewhat decent job with good pay, but good chances to get a better job
- more or less money :D depending on my success, which I'm only mildly confident in
- staying at a bad job will hurt my emotional well being, which is directly tied to my physical well being
- I might have to continue to spend over 2h on my way to work which is a major pain and takes time away from stuff like working out
- less personal fulfillment, what if..

### Conclusion:

The things that could go wrong seem manageable and not that likely.

The cost of inaction is actually pretty low, because I have an amazing ass job.

The benefits are massive, even if this project won't be able to sustain me full time or I won't be able to sell it at a decent price, I will still have learned a shit ton, might have gotten to now a couple new people and it will very certainly help me in my future career should I consider to work as an employee at a company again, instead of founding the next business.
