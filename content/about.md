My name is Jonny Rimek. I've been a software engineer for 3 years. 

Currently, I work at [Healy GmbH](https://www.healyworld.net/in/wellness/) and help grow and optimise their distribution platform. In my free time I build my own bootstraped business [wowmate.io](https://wowmate.io). It's a SaaS that helps World of Warcraft players analyze their log files in order to improve.

I care a lot about privacy and security in general. In order to improve my 
privacy I use Ubuntu as operating system, Signal as a messenger, 
ProtonMail for E-Mail, ProtonVPN as VPN, Firefox as a Webbrowser and 
DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine. To secure my logins I use U2F 
with using the 
[Nitrokey](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-fido-u2f-20) 
where possible.
